# Rock-Paper-Scissors-JS
This my first attempt at a JS rock/paper/scissors game. This doesn't include a GUI and must be played in the console. (At least to see the results)
How To Play:
      To play the game use the Dev tools to inspect the page and the prompts will appear accordingly.
      Enter your guess of Rock/Paper/Scissors
      The computer will make a guess
      The game keeps score and after someone reaches 5 points they are declared the winner.
